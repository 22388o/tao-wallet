## DDD and Clean Architecture

The application follows the Uncle Bob "[Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)" principles and project structure :

### Clean Architecture layers

```
tbd
```

### Project anatomy

```
tbd
```

### The Dependency Rule

> The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.
